## About The Wolfe Studio Archive

From entertaining adventures abroad to heartfelt advice and poignant life philosophies, the Wolfe family letters have allowed us meaningful glimpses into the lives of artists, their friends, and their work. In addition to furthering the field of digital humanities by providing a space for students to develop skills in transcribing, archival work, scanning, and research, the documents at Wolfe Studio provide an entryway into a wide array of topics and historical moments. These moments include World War II, military life, popular books and magazines throughout the decades, art shows and exhibits, and even contemporary discussion of Mississippi’s one and only Eudora Welty.

It is also fascinating to see how through the decades, people and their daily lives don’t change all that much. In a series of letters sent by Mildred Wolfe to her friend Margaret Alexander, Mildred discusses summer plans and striving to get good grades. In an exchange between Karl Wolfe and Wayne Wills, Wayne lists his Christmas presents; another sees him discussing Karl’s book. While we may be far from these people in time and space, their writings emphasize their humanity and the value of friends, family, and community.

Moving forward, the Wolfe Studio team continues to undertake the process of organizing, labelling, transcribing, coding, and scanning the documents in the Wolfe Archives. In addition, the data being input into the archive’s spreadsheet will be used to continuously update this CollectionBuilder site so that the documents and research data can exist in a secure and enduring space, ensuring a lasting legacy for the Wolfes.
